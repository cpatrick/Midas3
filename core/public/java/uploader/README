To build MidasUploader, simply execute the build.sh or build.bat script.

This requires a JDK>1.3, and that the binary files are
in your path.
It also requires you to have created a Certificate using
the "keytool" supplied with the SUN jdk. There is one in the keystore that
is shipped in the Midas repository (see the file kitware!.keystore), but if
it expires you can use the following command to generate a replacement:

keytool -genkey -alias mycert -keypass kitware! -validity 730

That will create a key that is valid for 730 days (2 years).  Note that
this key is still not verified by a trusted authority, so a warning will
appear the first time it is loaded.
